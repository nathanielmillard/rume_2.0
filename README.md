# Rume
###### An interactive emotional experience | A digital space to sit and ruminate.

## Hello 👋🏻
If you have made it here this is the solo refactor/reflection on a project I made while in school. The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/nathanielmillard/rume) and it was a pretty neat little app we were very proud of at the time! Both [Kristi](https://github.com/Kristiannmiller) and [Brigette](https://github.com/BrigetteDoelp) are great engineers worth checking out at well!

I am hitting the year mark after graduation and thought it could be fun to reflect on and dig into the code a little bit for some previous projects and see what I have learned in my time working since...

#### The Original Project

This page is still under construction but my goals are to document my initial reactions looking at this code I haven't touched in a while, do a bit of a postmortem on the code itself, and then maybe even look at some tech improvements/expansions on the project itself.
